Hello everyone,

<br><br><br>

I am Eric Goh, and I am your course lecturer. I work as data science research analyst, software engineer, and lecturer in various industries, specializing in machine learning, data science and robotics. I founded SVBook Pte. Ltd. (www.svbook.com) to help people get into the field of Data Science and programming at affordable price and introductory level. I also teaches at EMHAcademy.com. and developed my own data science software as pet project at http://dstk.tech to assist me in my data science projects. 
<br><br>
I also published "Learn R for Applied Statistics" book at Apress, and published 7 books at LeanPub and SVBook. I created and taught 28 data science courses, and 7 advanced certificate programmes at Udemy and EMHAcademy.
<br><br>
I graduated from National University of Singapore with a Master of Technology Degree in Knowledge Engineering, and an Executive MBA degree from the U21Global (currently GlobalNxt) and Indira Gandhi National Open University. I holds a Graduate Diploma in Mechatronics from A*STAR SIMTech (in Nanyang Technological University) and a Bachelor of Science degree in Computing from the University of Portsmouth and a Diploma (merit) in Electonics and Computer Engineering from Ngee Ann Polytechnic. 
<br><br>
I am excited to guide you in understanding more about data science, machine learning, natural language processing, data and text mining, social network analysis, and programming.
