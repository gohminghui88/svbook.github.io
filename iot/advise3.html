Dear Everyone, 
<br>
<br>

As a general tip shared with others, Internet of Things is a multi discipline field, hence, it is a job arguably hard to replace. If you are interested in going into this field, you may consider learning electronics, mechnical engineering and 3D Design (Product Design), networking, mobile app development, and some data science. 
<br /><br />
Coursera or Udacity also offered some Specialization Certificates in these fields. 
<br /><br />
If you want, you can study the Specialization Certificate in Introduction to Programming the Internet of Things from UCI and Coursera from https://www.coursera.org/specializations/iot, 

<br /><br />
or the Specialization Certificate in Developing Industrial Internet of Things from University of Colorado and Cousera from https://www.coursera.org/specializations/developing-industrial-iot. .
<br /><br />
For UCI, thhe course used Arduino and Raspberry Pi. For Univeristy of POrtsmouth and Kaplan, the course used NodeMCU. I added in Raspberry Pi which is optional. 
<br><br>

Thank you. 
<br><br>
Kind Regards,
<br> 
Eric Goh
