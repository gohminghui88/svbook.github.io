Hello everyone,

<br /><br /><br />
Just in case, plagiarism can be avoided using paraphrasing, citing, quoting, and referencing for formal documents. 
<br /><br />
Ref: <a target="blank" href="http://en.writecheck.com/ways-to-avoid-plagiarism/">http://en.writecheck.com/ways-to-avoid-plagiarism/</a>
<br /><br />
I have seen some asking or talking about plagiarism related questions. 

<br /><br /><br /><br />
For less formal documentations, 
<br /><br />
You may use attribution by giving appropriate credits like name, links and etc. 
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
(Based on the least strict license available, and depending on the university for your course)

<br /><br /><br /><br />
For softwares, there are GPL, LGPL, and  etc. license that may need to be adhere if stated by the author. 

<br /><br /><br /><br />
I have developed the WriterHelper software at <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/writerhelpersoft/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/writerhelpersoft/</a>
<br /><br />
WriterHelper consist of WordNet Dictionary, WordNet Thesaurus, Plagiarism Checker, Encryption using TripleDES, DES, and AES.
<br /><br />
WriterHelper helps you to search for the dictionary, thesaurus using WordNet Dictionary, Encrypt Text using AES, DES, TripleDES, and Plagiarism CHecking.

<br /><br /><br /><br />
Thank you. 
<br /><br />
Kind Regards,
