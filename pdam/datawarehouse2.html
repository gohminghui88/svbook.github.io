Hello everyone,

<br /><br /><br />
As shared with others, it is good to know that ETL is Extract data from databases and data sources, Transform the data, then Load the data into databases or data warehouses. 
 <br /><br />
ELT is also existed, where ELT is Extract of data from databases and data sources, Load the data into databases and data warehouses, then Transform the data. The data can be transformed using database SQL after loading. 

<br /><br />
Thank You. 
<br /><br />
Kind Regards, 
<br />
Eric Goh
