Hello everyone,

<br /><br /><br />

As a general tip shared with others, Data Science is a multi discipline field, hence, it is a job arguably hard to replace.  If you are interested in going into this field, you may consider learning statistics, python, and some big data to compliment this course, with accordance to the course structure of EdX Micromaster certificate in Data Science from UC San Diego. Coursera or Udacity also offered some Specialization Certificates in these fields. If you have some engineering knowledge, you may also consider progressing into Internet of Things. 
 
<br /><br />
Thank You. 
<br /><br />
Kind Regards, 
<br />
Eric Goh
