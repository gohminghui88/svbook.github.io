Hello Everyone, 

<br /><br />

Some of you may asked about what is the jobs prospect of computer science. For general information, you may refer to:

<br /><br />
From my perspective, you can proceed to developer path or non-developer path. 
<br /><br />

<u>Developer Path or Software Engineer:</u>
<br /><br />
For developer path, usually, you will need to slowly progress towards enterprise Java (Enterprise Java Beans, Struts, MVC, ...) from your java course, or enterprise .Net (ASP.Net MVC) from C#, depending on your location and technology advancements. Java, Python, C# are still the base programming language that usually will be there. In development, you can take up:

<br />
<ul>
<li> 
- front-end developer (UI design, HTML, CSS, JS) - the beautiful website you sees everyday
</li>
<li>
- back-end developer (EJB, Struts, ...) - business logic: how the website react to the web forms you filled up
</li>
<li>
- database related roles (SQL, MS SQL, ...) - where the form data filled up by you stored 
</li>
<li>
- Mobile App Developer (Java for Android, Objective C for iPhone, C# for windows Apps)
</li>
<li>
- Software Tester <br /><br />
(industrial cert to accompany in years to come: MCSD, oracle certified enterprise architect (OCEA) )
</li>
</ul>

<br />

<u>For Non-Developer Path, you can focus on network, cyber security, and etc.</u> 

<ul>
<li>
- Network Administrator (industrial cert to accompany: CCNA, CCNP, MCSE)
</li>
<li>
- Business Analyst
</li>
<li>
- Security Professional (industrial cert to accompany: CISSP, Certified Ethical Hacker, AISP)
</li>
</ul>

<br />

<u>For Multi-Disciplinary:</u> 

<ul>
<li>
- Data Science Analyst or Data Scientist (Need Statistics, Computer Science (with Artificial Intelligence and data mining), preferably some business knowledge)
</li>
<li>
- Internet of Things, IoT (Need Computer Science and some hardware related Engineering)
</li>
</ul>

<br />
Hopefully, you can plan your path from here. For myself, I am in the Data Science field.
<br /><br />
Thank You. 
<br /><br />
Kind Regards,
<br /> 
Eric Goh
