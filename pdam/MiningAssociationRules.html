Dear Everyone, 
<br />
<br />

As shared with others, we have talked about machine learning tool such as Weka which can developed into a desktop software. We have also talked about Microsoft Azure cloud machine learning services, that can be used to develop web applications. If you have developed your own pet software, you may consider uploading them to sourceforge and github. Personally, i uses sourceforge to upload my Data Science Toolkit (DSTK) software. Github has also offers github pages as personal portfolio . All these can be put into your CV or resume. 

<br /><br />

Thank you. 
<br /><br />
Kind Regards,
<br /> 
Eric Goh
