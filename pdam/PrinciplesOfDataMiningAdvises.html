Dear Everyone, 
<br />
<br />
As an advises, besides Weka, there are R and python libraries like nltk and scikit learn, where you can use to develop your own desktop applications. Weka can be used with Java, Accord.Net can be used with C#. If you want open source or free SPSS or SAS alternative, you may look into RapidMiner (can use weka) and Knime, or JASP. 
<br /><br />
Thank you. 
<br /><br />
Kind Regards,
<br /> 
Eric Goh
