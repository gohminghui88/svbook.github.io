Dear Everyone, 
<br />
<br />
As shared with others, you may be interested to take some courses at MOOCs like Coursera and EdX. Coursera and EdX offered some courses in R programming, which includes course matetials from universities for free. Certification may require some payment. 
<br /><br />
Eg.

<br /><br />
 I would recommend RStudio with R. 
<br /><br />

Thank you. 
<br /><br />
Kind Regards,
<br />
