Dear Everyone, 
<br />
<br />
As a tip shared with others, you may want to look into professional societies like IEEE and ACM. They have interests groups in Machine learning for networking, and have discounts for students memberships. Student membership may have free Microsoft softwares. If you want to works towards chartered engineer or chartered IT professional, you may look into British Computer Society or IET. 
<br /><br />

Thank you. 
<br /><br />
Kind Regards,
<br /> 
Eric Goh
