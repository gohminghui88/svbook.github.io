Dear Everyone, 
<br />
<br />
As an advise, Data mining usually deals with numerical data. Text mining is another field that deals with textual data, which can leverages on natural language processing to analyse the data. Social Network Analysis uses data to plot a network graph to analyse the social network and relationships between people. Social media analysis can includes the analysis of forums, Twitter, facebook posts, which usually involves text mining. Some time, data mining is a higher term that includes text mining. 
<br /><br />
Statistics can be used to analyse numerical data and visualizes them using data visualizations. Machine learning are algorithms used to learnt from past data and classify new data. Statistical algorithm like naive bayes (probability) can also be used to classify data. Text classification usually converts common word into numbers, and then use machine learning algorithm to train and classify. CRISP DM is a data mining process. You may argue that statistics and visualizations are used more in data exploration stage, while machine learning and naive bayes are used more in modeling and evaluation stage.

Thank you.
