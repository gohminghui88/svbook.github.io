Dear Everyone, 
<br />
<br />
A tip shared with others also, if you want to develop machine learning system, you can starts with cloud services like Microsoft Azure, or Amazon AWS service.

Personally, I use Azure for my data science big data applications, that leverages on machine learning algorithm to predict variables. Please do not forget to delete the cluster after using, you will be charged money for not deleting the cluster. However, you will have some free trial to play with the system. 
<br /><br />
Thank you. 
<br /><br />
Kind Regards,
<br />
